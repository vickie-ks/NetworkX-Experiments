## Network Analysis: Network Metrics

#### ~ Comparative Analysis of Network Metrics between Network 1 and Network 2
The network metrics that may explain the difference between network 1 (collaboration network) and network 2 (conflict network) include
- **Density**: Density indicates the proportion of edges in a network relative to the total possible edges. A higher density suggests a denser network with more connections.
- **Average Degree**: Average degree refers to the average number of connections per node in the network. It can provide insight into how well-connected the nodes are on average.
- **Clustering Coefficient**: Clustering coefficient measures the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together. Higher clustering coefficient indicates more tightly knit communities within the network.
- **Average Shortest Path Length**: This metric calculates the average shortest path between all pairs of nodes in the network. It can provide insight into how efficiently information or influence can spread through the network.

In a collaboration network:
- **Expectation**: Higher density, average degree, and clustering coefficient. Indicating a denser, more interconnected structure conducive to trust and cooperation.
- **Shorter average shortest path length**: Suggesting more efficient communication and collaboration due to shorter paths between nodes.

In a conflict network:
- **Expectation**: Lower values for density, average degree, and clustering coefficient. Reflecting a less cohesive structure with more isolated nodes and less cooperation.
- **Potentially longer average shortest path length**: Indicating less efficient communication and collaboration with longer paths between nodes.

#### ~ Reflection on Expected vs. Actual Network Metrics Results

The calculated network metrics align with our expectations based on the differences between collabo- ration and conflict networks.

In the collaboration network:
- Higher values for density (0.4082), average degree (15.1053), and clustering coefficient (0.6038) are observed.
- These values indicate a denser and more interconnected structure with tighter clusters of nodes, characteristic of a collaborative environment.
- The average shortest path length (1.5946) suggests efficient communication and collaboration, as information or influence can propagate relatively quickly through the network.

In contrast, the conflict network exhibits:
- Lower values for density (0.1110), average degree (4.4390), and clustering coefficient (0.0000).
- This indicates a less cohesive structure with fewer connections and less clustering among
nodes.
- The higher average shortest path length (1.9171) in the conflict network implies less efficient
communication and collaboration, potentially more prone to delays or obstacles.


Overall, the calculated metrics support the expected differences between collaboration and conflict networks, providing insights into their respective structural characteristics and dynamics.
